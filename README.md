# Outfit7 Apps

Outfit7 Apps is a demo app which gathers all currently installed outfit7 apps in a single app which basically acts like an app switcher. Besides that, it contains more info about package name, version name and version code for each app.

This project is a simple example showing MVP architecture using Dagger2.
